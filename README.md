# LUNAR | 2D Game Engine

![alt text](https://i.ibb.co/JQ2tZkK/Neues-Projekt.png)

Welcome to ****LUNAR****, a 2D game engine built to demonstrate and enhance my coding skills. While I recognize that this engine isn't flawless and isn't intended for making professional games, it symbolizes my learning journey in software development. This project is a personal endeavor, reflecting my passion for unraveling the inner workings of intricate software systems.

## Current Plans and Goals

My plans for this engine is to make:

<details>
<summary><b>A Scene System</b></summary>

The engine will offer a Scene Manager to seamlessly transition between different game scenes. This simplifies the process of displaying various environments without the need to manage entities or sprite visibility manually.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>A Dialogue System</b></summary>

The engine will feature a Dialogue System that manages interactions between in-game entities. This system will include a dialogue queue and a dynamic text field on the screen for displaying dialogues. Additionally, it will offer customizable options for dialogue box placement and special effects, such as typewriter or shaking effects.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>A Audio System</b></summary>

The engine will be equipped with an Audio System capable of playing various sounds. It will manage sound queues for both background and foreground audio. The system will support simultaneous sound playback and allow for sound cancellation at any point in the game.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>A Animation System</b></summary>

The Animator will be integrated into the engine to handle animations for various in-game objects. The Animator will manage a queue of pre-loaded animations, offering options like idle animations and adjustable animation speeds. Animation frames can be loaded from sprite atlases or individual images stored in folders.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>A Controller System</b></summary>

The engine will provide an Object Controller, which can be used to create a Keyboard Controller for player movement and interactions. This system will also enable control over any in-game object at any location or time.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>A Collision System</b></summary>

The engine will use a Collision Detection System to identify interactions between game objects configured for collision. This system will monitor movements initiated by any Object Controller and assess whether collisions occur along both the X and Y axes.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>A HUD and Menu</b></summary>

A dedicated system will be implemented to handle the drawing of the heads-up display (HUD) or in-game menus.

</details>

My initial objective in developing this engine is to use it for a short story-based 2D game.
